## Compiling instructions

Download and install Go from [Go Downloads](https://golang.org/dl/) for your
platform.

### Linux/OSX

We use the `dep` tool provided by Golang for managing dependencies. As it is not officially part
of the go tools package suite, you will need to manually install it if you have not already.

On MacOS you can install or upgrade to the latest released version with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install dep
brew upgrade dep
```

On linux or MacOS, you can also install it via `go get`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
```

After `dep` is installed, please follow the instructions below:

```bash
go get github.com/thrasher-/gocryptotrader
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/thrasher-/gocryptotrader
make get
make install
cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/thrasher-/gocryptotrader/config_example.json $GOPATH/bin/config.json
```

### Windows

```bash
go get github.com/thrasher-/gocryptotrader
cd %GOPATH%\src\github.com\thrasher-\gocryptotrader
go install
copy %GOPATH%\src\github.com\thrasher-\gocryptotrader\config_example.json %GOPATH%\bin\config.json
```

+ Make any neccessary changes to the `config.json` file.
+ Run the `gocryptotrader` binary file inside your GOPATH bin folder.
